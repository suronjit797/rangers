        "question": "Difference between authorization and authentication",
        "answer": "Authentication verifies who the user is. Authorization determines what resources a user can access. Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user. Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process. Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular. More formally, to authorize is to define an access policy."

        "question": " What other services does firebase provide other than authentication",
        "answer": "In Firebase Authentication, there are two main types of authentication. This classification represents the difference in authentication timing and active relationship. 1.User Authentication 2.Anonymous Authentication.User authentication is an active authentication performed by the user. It uses an email address or an authentication provider to authenticate.The timing of anonymous authentication may vary depending on the configuration, but it is basically passive. In most cases, it does not have to be at page load time, and can be done after user interaction"
